# accuknox_kubearmor_namespace_visibility (Resource)

`accuknox_kubearmor_namespace_visibility` will give us the ability to manage the namespace visibilty. KubeArmor currently supports enabling visibility for containers and hosts. Visibility for hosts is not enabled by default, however it is enabled by default for containers. Read more about namespace visibility [here](https://github.com/kubearmor/KubeArmor/blob/main/getting-started/kubearmor_visibility.md#updating-namespace-visibility).

## Example Usage

Here, we are updating visibility for namespace `wordpress-mysql`.

```
resource "accuknox_kubearmor_namespace_visibility" "visib-ns1" {
  namespace     = "wordpress-mysql"
  file          = true
  network       = true
  capabilities  = true
  process       = true
}
```
